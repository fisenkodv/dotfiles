# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment Oh My Zsh only considers the very latest commit to be supported.
We combine that with our fast response to incidents, so risk is minimized.

| Version        | Supported          |
|:-------------- |:------------------ |
| master         | :white_check_mark: |
| other commits  | :x:                |

In the near future we will introduce versioning, so expect this section to change.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, email all the maintainers directly at:

- Robby: robby [at] planetargon.com
- Marc: hello [at] mcornella.com

**Do not open an issue or Pull Request directly**, because it might reveal the vulnerability.
