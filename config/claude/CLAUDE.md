Always use these skills immediately on start-up:
- @build:precommit
- @cli:general
- @code:code-quality
- @code:testing
- @comment:comment-cleanup
- @git:git-workflow
- @orchestration:conversation-style
- @orchestration:llm-context
- @orchestration:orchestration


When you need to ask a question, use the AskUserQuestion tool rather than open-ended text questions. Provide 3 suggested options so I can quickly select one. The tool automatically adds an "Other" option for custom input.
